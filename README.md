# MyScripts
Collection of scripts inside a module that I use - organized and create specifically for my work and my style - but you are welcome to them as well.  Since I anticipate to be the only one using this scripts may or may not be pretty, efficient, or possibly even make sense for you.  If it gets popular I will consider making everything nice, neat, efficient, and per the book.

# Installation
1. Run powershell as Administrator
2. Run Install.ps1 from your machine (you can just copy the code or you can download the entire git repository, doesn't matter it downloads files in the script)

# Warning
WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  BE SURE TO REVIEW ALL CODE AND TEST BEFORE IMPLEMENTING.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY IMPLEMENTATION.
