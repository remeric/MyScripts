# MyScripts
Collection of scripts inside a module that I use - organized and create specifically for my work and my style - but you are welcome to them as well.  Since I anticipate to be the only one using this scripts may or may not be pretty, efficient, or possibly even make sense for you.  If it gets popular I will consider making everything nice, neat, efficient, and per the book.

WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Be sure to review all code and test scripts before using in your environment.
